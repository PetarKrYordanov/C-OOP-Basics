# : Encapsulation

This document defines the **exercise assignments** for the [&quot;CSharp OOP Basics&quot; course @ Software University](https://softuni.bg/courses/csharp-oop-basics). Please submit your solutions (source code) of all below described problems in [Judge](https://judge.softuni.bg/Contests/232/Encapsulation-Exercise).

1. Problem 1.Class Box

You are given a geometric figure box with parameters length, width and height. Model a class Box that that can be instantiated by the same three parameters. Expose to the outside world only methods for its surface area, lateral surface area and its volume (formulas: [http://www.mathwords.com/r/rectangular\_parallelepiped.htm](http://www.mathwords.com/r/rectangular_parallelepiped.htm)).

On the first three lines you will get the length, width and height. On the next three lines print the surface area, lateral surface area and the volume of the box:

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 234 | Surface Area – 52.00Lateral Surface Area – 40.00Volume – 24.00 |
| 1.316 | Surface Area - 30.20Lateral Surface Area - 27.60Volume - 7.80 |

1. Problem 2.Class Box Data Validation

A box&#39;s side should not be zero or a negative number. Expand your class from the previous problem by adding data validation for each parameter given to the constructor. Make a private setter that performs data validation internally.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 2-34 | Width cannot be zero or negative. |

1. Problem 3.Animal Farm

You should be familiar with encapsulation already. For this problem, you&#39;ll be working with the **Animal Farm project**. It contains a class Chicken. Chicken contains several fields, a constructor, several properties and several methods. Your task is to encapsulate or hide anything that is not intended to be viewed or modified from outside the class.

### Step 1. Encapsulate Fields

Fields should be **private**. Leaving fields open for modification from outside the class is potentially dangerous. Make all fields in the Chicken class private.

In case the value inside a field is needed elsewhere, use **getters** to reveal it.

### Step 2. Ensure Classes Have a Correct State

Having **getters and setters** is useless if you don&#39;t actually use them. The Chicken constructor modifies the fields directly which is wrong when there are suitable setters available. Modify the constructor to fix this issue.

### Step 3. Validate Data Properly

Validate the chicken&#39;s **name** (it cannot be null, empty or whitespace). In case of **invalid name** , print exception message: **&quot;Name cannot be empty.&quot;**.

Validate the **age** properly, minimum and maximum age are provided, make use of them. In case of **invalid age** , print exception message: **&quot;Age should be between 0 and 15.&quot;**.

Don&#39;t forget to handle properly the possibly thrown exceptions.

### Step 4. Hide Internal Logic

If a method is intended to be used only by descendant classes or internally to perform some action, there is no point in keeping them **public**. The **CalculateProductPerDay()** method is used by the **ProductPerDay** public getter. This means the method can safely be hidden inside the Chicken class by declaring it **private**.

### Step 5. Submit Code to Judge

Submit your code as a zip file in Judge. Zip everything except the bin and obj folders within the project and submit the single zip file in judge.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| Mara10 | Chicken Mara (age 10) can produce 1 eggs per day. |
| Mara17 | Age should be between 0 and 15. |

1. Problem 4.Shopping Spree

Create two classes: **class**** Person **and** class ****Product**. Each person should have a **name** , **money** and a **bag**** of products **. Each product should have** name **and** cost **. Name cannot be an** empty string **. Money cannot be a** negative number**.

Create a program in which **each command** corresponds to a **person buying a product**. If the person can **afford** a product **add** it to his bag. If a person **doesn&#39;t have enough** money, print an **appropriate**** message** (&quot;[Person name] can&#39;t afford [Product name]&quot;).

On the **first two lines** you are given **all people** and **all products**. After all purchases print **every person** in the order of **appearance** and **all products** that he has **bought** also in order of **appearance**. If **nothing is bought** , print the name of the person followed by &quot; **Nothing bought**&quot;.

In case of **invalid input** (negative money exception message: &quot; **Money cannot be negative**&quot;) or empty name (empty name exception message: &quot; **Name cannot be empty**&quot;) **break** the program with an appropriate message. See the examples below:

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| Pesho=11;Gosho=4Bread=10;Milk=2;Pesho BreadGosho MilkGosho MilkPesho MilkEND | Pesho bought BreadGosho bought MilkGosho bought MilkPesho can&#39;t afford MilkPesho - BreadGosho - Milk, Milk |
| Mimi=0Kafence=2Mimi KafenceEND | Mimi can&#39;t afford KafenceMimi – Nothing bought |
| Jeko=-3Chushki=1;Jeko ChushkiEND | Money cannot be negative |

1. Problem 5.Pizza Calories

A Pizza is made of dough and different toppings. You should model a **class Pizza,** which should have a **name** , **dough** and **toppings** as fields. Every type of **ingredient** should have its **own class**. Every ingredient has different properties: the **dough** can be white or wholegrain and in addition, it can be crispy, chewy or homemade. The **toppings** can be of type meat, veggies, cheese or sauce. **Every ingredient** should have a **weight** in grams and a method for **calculating** its calories according to its type. Calories per gram are calculated through **modifiers**. Every ingredient has 2 calories per gram as a **base** and a **modifier** that **gives** the **exact** calories. For example, a white dough has a modifier of 1.5, a chewy dough has a modifier of 1.1, which means that a **white**** chewy **dough, weighting** 100 ****grams** will have 100 \* 1.5 \* 1.1 = 330.00 **total**** calories**.

**Your job** is to model the classes in such a way that they are **properly encapsulated** and to provide a public method for every pizza that **calculates its calories according to the ingredients it has**.

### **Step 1. Create a Dough Class**

The base ingredient of a Pizza is the dough. First, you need to create a **class** for it. It has a **flour type,** which can be **white** or **wholegrain**. In addition, it has a **baking technique,** which can be **crispy** , **chewy** or **homemade**. A dough should have a **weight** in grams. The calories per gram of a dough are calculated depending on the flour type and the baking technique. Every dough has 2 calories per gram as a base and a modifier that gives the exact calories. For example, a white dough has a modifier of 1.5, a chewy dough has a modifier of 1.1, which means that a **white**** chewy ****dough** , weighting **100**** grams**will have (2 \* 100) \* 1.5 \* 1.1 = 330.00**total ****calories**. You are given the modifiers below:

**Modifiers:**

- White – 1.5;
- Wholegrain – 1.0;
- Crispy – 0.9;
- Chewy – 1.1;
- Homemade – 1.0;

Everything that the class should expose is a getter for the calories per gram. Your task is to create the class with a proper constructor, fields, getters and setters. Make sure you use the proper access modifiers.

### **Step 2. Validate Data for the Dough Class**

Change the internal logic of the Dough class by adding a data validation in the setters.

Make sure that if **invalid flour type** or an **invalid baking technique** is given a proper **exception** is thrown with the message **&quot;Invalid type of dough.&quot;**.

The allowed weight of a dough is in the range [1..200] grams. If it is outside of this range throw an exception with the message **&quot;Dough weight should be in the range [1..200].&quot;**.

### **Exception Messages**

- &quot;Invalid type of dough.&quot;
- &quot;Dough weight should be in the range [1..200].&quot;

Make a test in your main method that reads Doughs and prints their calories until an &quot;END&quot; command is given.

### **Examples**

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| Dough White Chewy 100END | 330.00 |
| Dough Tip500 Chewy 100END | Invalid type of dough. |
| Dough White Chewy 240END | Dough weight should be in the range [1..200]. |

### **Step 3. Create a Topping Class**

Next, you need to create a **Topping class**. It can be of four different types – **meat** , **veggies** , **cheese** or a **sauce**. A topping has a **weight** in grams. The calories per gram of topping are calculated depending on its type. The **base calories** per gram are **2**. Every different type of topping has a modifier. For example, meat has a modifier of 1.2, so a meat topping will have 1.2 calories per gram (1 \* 1.2). Everything that the class should expose is a getter for calories per gram. You are given the modifiers below:

Modifiers:

- Meat – 1.2;
- Veggies – 0.8;
- Cheese – 1.1;
- Sauce – 0.9;

Your task is to create the class with a proper constructor, fields, getters and setters. Make sure you use the proper access modifiers.

### **Step 4. Validate Data for the Topping Class**

Change the internal logic of the Topping class by adding a data validation in the setter.

Make sure the topping is one of the provided types, otherwise throw a proper exception with the message **&quot;Cannot place [name of invalid argument] on top of your pizza.&quot;**.

The allowed weight of a topping is in the range [1..50] grams. If it is outside of this range throw an exception with the message **&quot;[Topping type name] weight should be in the range [1..50].&quot;**.

### **Exception Messages**

- &quot;Cannot place [name of invalid argument] on top of your pizza.&quot;
- &quot;[Topping type name] weight should be in the range [1..50].&quot;

Make a test in your main method that reads a single dough and a topping after that and prints their calories.

### **Examples**

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| Dough White Chewy 100Topping meat 30END | 330.0072.00 |
| Dough White chewy 100Topping Krenvirshi 500END | 330.00Cannot place Krenvirshi on top of your pizza. |
| Dough White Chewy 100Topping Meat 500END | 330.00Meat weight should be in the range [1..50]. |

### **Step 5. Create a Pizza Class!**

A Pizza should have a **name** , some **toppings** and a **dough**. Make use of the two classes you made earlier. In addition, a pizza should have **public getters** for its **name** , **number of toppings** and the **total calories**. The **total calories** are **calculated by summing the calories of all the ingredients a pizza has**. Create the class using a proper constructor, expose a method for adding a topping, a public setter for the dough and a getter method for the total calories.

The input for a pizza consists of **several**** lines **. On the first line is the** pizza name **and on the second line, you will get input for the** dough**. On the next lines, you will receive every topping the pizza has.

If creation of the pizza was **successful,** print on a single line the name of the pizza and the **total calories** it has.

### **Step 6. Validate Data for the Pizza Class**

The **name** of the pizza should **not** be an **empty string**. In addition, it should **not be longer than 15 symbols**. If it does not fit, throw an **exception** with the message **&quot;Pizza name should be between 1 and 15 symbols.&quot;**.

The **number of toppings** should be in range [0..10]. If not, throw an **exception** with the message **&quot;Number of toppings should be in range [0..10].&quot;**.

Your task is to print the **name** of the pizza and the **total**** calories** it has according to the examples below.

### **Examples**

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| Pizza MeatlessDough Wholegrain Crispy 100Topping Veggies 50Topping Cheese 50END | Meatless - 370.00 Calories. |
| Pizza BurgasDough White Homemade 200Topping Meat 123END | Meat weight should be in the range [1..50]. |
| Pizza BulgarianDough White Chewy 100Topping Sauce 20Topping Cheese 50Topping Cheese 40Topping Meat 10Topping Sauce 10Topping Cheese 30Topping Cheese 40Topping Meat 20Topping Sauce 30Topping Cheese 25Topping Cheese 40Topping Meat 40END | Number of toppings should be in range [0..10]. |
| Pizza BulgarianDough White Chewy 100Topping Sirene 50Topping Cheese 50Topping Krenvirsh 20Topping Meat 10END | Cannot place Sirene on top of your pizza. |

1. Problem 6.\*\*Football Team Generator

A football team has variable **number of players** , a **name** and a **rating**. A player has a **name** and **stats**** , **which are the basis for his skill level. The stats a player has are** endurance **,** sprint **,** dribble **,** passing **and** shooting **. Each stat can be an** integer**in the range [0..100]. The overall**skill ****level** of a **player** is calculated as the **average** of his **stats**. Only the **name** of a player and his **stats** should be visible to the entire outside world. **Everything**** else **should be** hidden**.

A team should expose a **name** , a **rating** (calculated by the average skill level of all players in the team and **rounded** to the **integer** part only) and **methods** for **adding** and **removing**** players**.

Your task is to **model** the **team** and the **players** following the proper principles of **Encapsulation**. Expose **only** the properties that need to be visible and **validate**** dat ****a** appropriately.

### Input

Your application will receive commands until the &quot; **END**&quot; command is given. The command can be one of the following:

- **&quot;Team;\&lt;TeamName\&gt;&quot;** – add a new team;
- **&quot;Add;\&lt;TeamName\&gt;;\&lt;PlayerName\&gt;;\&lt;Endurance\&gt;;\&lt;Sprint\&gt;;\&lt;Dribble\&gt;;\&lt;Passing\&gt;;\&lt;Shooting\&gt;&quot;** – add a new player to the team;
- **&quot;Remove;\&lt;TeamName\&gt;;\&lt;PlayerName\&gt;&quot;** –remove the player from the team;
- **&quot;Rating;\&lt;TeamName\&gt;&quot;** – print the team rating, rounded to an integer.

### Data Validation

- A name cannot be null, empty or white space. If not, print **&quot;**** A name should not be empty. ****&quot;**
- Stats should be in the range 0..100. If not, print **&quot;[Stat name]**  **should be between 0 and 100.****&quot;**
- If you receive a command to remove a missing player, print **&quot;**** Player [Player name] is not in [Team name] team. ****&quot;**
- If you receive a command to add a player to a missing team, print **&quot;Team [team name] does not exist.&quot;**
- If you receive a command to show stats for a missing team, print **&quot;**** Team [team name] does not exist. ****&quot;**
